strange girl (lyrics)
\
composer: insert
\
i met a different girl
\
i fell in love and it was so suddenly
\
i never thought i could like it
\
from a girl who only knows how to snub me
\
\
and she already goes to college and i'm here
\
learning to drive
\
i don't even know if i'll graduate
\
and she says a little boy like that
\
who just wants to have fun
\
it will never win you over
\
\
(chorus)
\
she doesn't like my clothes
\
she keeps talking about my hair
\
she always complains about my strange way of speaking
\
but when she kisses my mouth
\
she loses her mind and goes crazy
\
it's a matter of time before you surrender
